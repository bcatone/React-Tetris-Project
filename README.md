TETRIS GAME CLONE

This was a collaborative Phase 2 project at Flatiron's Software Engineering Bootcamp and features a clone of the classic game Tetris. 

For this application we utilized React.js to build an interactive UI and complex algorithms to showcase our proficiency in front-end development. 

If you are unfamiliar, the rules of the game are listed below. We hope you enjoy!
